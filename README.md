Automated data analysis script with visualizations


### Autolysis: Automated Data Analysis and Narrative Generation
Autolysis is a Python-based tool that automates the process of analyzing datasets, generating visualizations, and creating insightful narratives using an LLM (Language Learning Model). This project simplifies exploratory data analysis (EDA) and report generation for datasets in CSV format.

### Features
* Automatic Encoding Detection: Ensures compatibility with various CSV encodings using chardet.
* Descriptive Analysis: Summarizes dataset statistics, identifies missing values, and computes correlations.
* Visualizations: Generates distribution plots for numeric columns (limited to the first three for simplicity).
* LLM Integration: Creates detailed narratives based on the dataset's analysis using an AI-powered API.
* Output Management: Saves visualizations and narratives in the dataset's directory
  
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 or higher
* The following Python packages:
* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* httpx
* chardet
